    <h1>Greetings! I am Vini and want to welcome all into the wonders of the chaos that is my mind!</h1> <h1>Welcome to <a href="http://viniverse.tilda.ws/"><em>The Viniverse</em></a></h1>
    <h4><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> I may try too hard to comedy my way through everything. Consider yourself warned.</h4>
    <p>The best way to describe myself would be as a chaotic good <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/cleric:nature">Nature Domain Cleric</a>! (YES a nerd! that's the word.)</p>
    <p>Even though the naming is quite self-explanatory (for those into DnD), what I mean is that I believe in a more relaxed approach to life with a pinch of seriousness (this part is mostly my anxiety speaking!). I like to try and learn different things, both to improve myself and to be able to help others as best I can. Throughout my life I may have wanted to become a whole variety of things, from Astronaut to Interpol detective, almost the full spectrum of life... honestly, still do. In case, by some reason, you would like to learn a bit more about me (in slightly more serious terms) go <a href="http://viniverse.tilda.ws/whodis">here</a></p>
    <p>My goal with this site is to have a single place where I can both display some of my abilities both as a researcher and as a developer, and also to flush some thoughts on everything I might find interesting. Given that my professional experience is kind of behind private repositories, I will have to build my own portfolio with personal "projects" of my own. This will definitely be more fun... also random, but fun!</p>
