            <p>Even though the naming is quite self-explanatory (for those into DnD), what I mean is that I believe in a more relaxed approach to life with lots of respect for everyone and everything, all with a pinch of seriousness (this part is mostly my anxiety speaking!). I like to try and learn different things, both to improve myself and to be able to help others as best I can.</p>

    <p>Throughout my life I may have wanted to become a whole variety of things, from Astronaut to Interpol detective, almost the full spectrum of life... honestly, still do. In case, by some reason, you would like to learn a bit more about me (in slightly more serious terms) go <a href="/about">here</a></p>
    <p>My goal with this site is to have a single place where I can both display some of my abilities both as a researcher and as a developer, and also to flush some thoughts on everything I might find interesting. Given that my professional experience is kind of behind private repositories, I will have to build my own portfolio with personal "projects" of my own. This will definitely be more fun... also random, but fun!</p>
