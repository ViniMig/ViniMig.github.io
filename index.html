                <p>The best way to describe myself would be as a chaotic good <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/cleric:nature" target="_blank">Nature Domain Cleric</a>! (YES a nerd! that's the word.)</p>
                <p>Even though the naming is quite self-explanatory (for those into DnD), what I mean is that I believe in a more relaxed approach to life with lots of respect for everyone and everything, all with a pinch of seriousness (this part is mostly my anxiety speaking!). I like to try and learn different things, both to improve myself and to be able to help others as best I can.</p>

            <p>Throughout my life I have wanted to become a whole variety of things: Astronaut, Interpol detective, Actor, Super-powered human being, Crazy Scientist, almost the full spectrum of life (real and imaginary)... and honestly, still dream about all that. In case you would like to learn a bit more about me (in slightly more serious terms) go <a href="/about">here</a>.</p>
            <p>My goal with this page is to have a single place where I can both display some of my abilities both as a researcher and as a developer, and also to flush some thoughts on everything I might find interesting. Some of my professional experience is in private repositories, therefore I will be building my own portfolio with personal "projects" and some exercises for practicing. This will definitely be more fun... also random, but fun!</p>
