## The theory of the Viniverse

Hi there! I decided to actually use a trustworthy service in github and github pages to put up my own personal page. It makes sense since it will be closer to my repositories. However the idea of putting something like this together as a kind of portfolio to showcase myself and at the same time a journal of my thoughts, activities and memories already existed for a while and I first tried with a different kind of service. <br><br>

By putting together my belief in human ability to do anything, the possibility of multiple universes, and influence from Sci-fi of course, all by throwing my name in there, brought me to the idea of Viniverse. This is the word that better describes my brain and ultimately this page.<br><br>

So!<br>
Instead of transcribing everything here from my first attempt, since all the effort still has its worth, I will just leave here the original page/text I wrote on my thoughts about Polymath, my belief that we all can do quite well in the most varied areas at the same time and, thus, the relation to and _raison d'Ãªtre_ of the [Viniverse](http://viniverse.tilda.ws/){:target="_blank"}.

Hope it is an entertaining read at the least and hopefully soon will have something else more specific to talk about, even more interesting! ...the bar is not set to high at least!
