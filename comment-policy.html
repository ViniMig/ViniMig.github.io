<h5>Comments are welcome and encouraged, but there are some instances where comments will be deleted as follows:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Comments deemed to be spam or solely promotional in nature will be deleted. Including a link to relevant content is permitted, but comments should be relevant to the post topic.</li>
    <li>Comments including profanity will be deleted.</li>
    <li>Comments containing language or concepts that could be deemed offensive will be deleted. Note this may include abusive, threatening, pornographic, offensive, misleading or libelous language.</li>
    <li>Comments that attack an individual directly will be deleted.</li>
    <li>Comments that harass other posters will be deleted. Please be respectful toward other contributors.</li>
    <li>Comments spreading misinformation will be deleted, unless stated as "personal opinion". Please try to source your claims, with valid sources, otherwise let it be known it is your own opinion on a given subject matter. The world is already overloaded with misinformation and corruption, we don't need to add to that pool.</li>
