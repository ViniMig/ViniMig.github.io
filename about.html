            <p>Graduated in <b>Biochemistry</b> from The University of Minho in 2012 and got my Master's in <b>Bioinformatics</b> in the same University in 2015. I started working as a <b>Research Technician</b> while developing my Master's thesis in <b>computational biology</b>. Worked for almost <b>5 years</b> in Spain as a <b>Software Development Engineer</b> in applications for High Content Screening. My most recent work was as a <b>Spotfire Consultant</b> for a Pharma project. Currently <u>looking for my next adventure</u> while working on various random personal projects!</p>

        <p>I recently realized that I am really enjoying building software and learning different languages and frameworks. Even if I may not master a particular one and you feel you have an interesting project please reach out, I am also a quite quick learner!</p>

                <h4>Bioinformatics and Systems Biology</h4>
                <p>Not only is this my background as at heart I have always been a man of science. Especially Biology and particularly evolution have always been the stuff of wonders for little Vini and adult Vini alike. Add that to a passion for technology and the sexiest mix of all times emerges. I will definitely improve and contribute more to Research and Development in this area, even if not professionally!</p>

                <h4>Machine Learning (AI)</h4>
                <p>I am very interested in learning more about AI as I am sure it is, quoting Andrew Ng "the new electricity" and will improve quality of life for all in the planet, not restricted to human life only. This technology has been growing at an amazing rate in the most recent years and currently the words "Machine Learning", "Artificial Intelligence", "Deep Learning" are on the mouths of everyone. Had the pleasure to complete 2 Coursera specializations, one in ML and another in DL, and currently undergoing an adventure in the world of Pytorch. AI is quite widespread and the next years may show quite exciting in this world and for the World. How soon will we see a real life Baymax?! Can't wait to see it!</p>

                <h4>Muay Thai</h4>
                <p>In recent years I also had the opportunity to dive deep into my passion regarding martial arts, Muay Thai more in particular. I can say it is one activity that is now part of my DNA and I can't recommend martial arts enough. The art of the eight limbs has such a beauty behind all the aggression it may portray. Everything rests on finesse, balance, relaxation, energy conservation, and for that you need to be strong not only physically but especially mentally. The Thai mentality of not letting yourself be consumed by your emotions is one of the greatest bridges one can bring from martial arts into life. <i>Sabai sabai</i> is simple yet beautiful and something we should all practice.</p>
