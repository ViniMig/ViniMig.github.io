        <h2>Work and Experience</h2>
        <p>Graduated in Biochemistry from The University of Minho in 2012 and got my Master's in Bioinformatics in the same University in 2015. I started working as a Research Technician while developing my Master's thesis in computational biology. Worked for almost 5 years in Spain as a Software Development Engineer in applications for High Content Screening.</p> <p>I am very interested in learning more about AI as I am sure it is, quoting Andrew Ng "the new electricity" and will improve quality of life for all in the planet, not restricted to human life only. In recent years I also had the opportunity to dive deep into my passion regarding martial arts, Muay Thai more in particular and it is one activity that is now part of my DNA. My biggest dream is to create products that will help to improve sustainability and life on this amazing planet.</p>
